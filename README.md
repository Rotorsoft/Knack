# Knak

This code was written in 2012. Most of the documentation is lost in the Codeplex archives.

But this is still up:

Knakit is a code generation tool for Knak commands. SQL Server tables and stored procedures can be converted to Knak Commands, Knak Repositories, Web API Controllers or any other type of entity that can be modeled via a T4 Template. For more information about how to use Knak, and to get some basic T4 templates, please visit our project site at http://knak.codeplex.com

How to use:

1. Get Knak Files via NuGet or download source from codeplex site.

2. Install this package (Knakit) via Extensions Manager or download and install the .vsix file manually.

3. Right click on any C# project and follow the Knak menu items to import tables, procedures, or preview and test existing Knak commands.
